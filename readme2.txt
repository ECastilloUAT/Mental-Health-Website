Mental_Health.html, style_resources.css, style.css
In Assignment 12.2 I needed to upload the style sheet (or sheets) for my design. It should include some of the customization for your site in the code.
I added

-A new link called "Resources"
-A user-friendly website within this link
-A position called "sticky"in styles.css to the header in order to make it move when the user scrolls
-A new css for the website called style_resources.css
-This css adds a side navigation bar and moves all the information to the right
