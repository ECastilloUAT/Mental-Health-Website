MH_Content.html, style_resources.css, MH_Info.html
In Assignment 13.1 I needed to upload progress checkpoint for my design. This includes all HTML and CSS with appropriate linking.
I added

-Two new website links to MH_Content.html and MH_Info.HTML
-A user-friendly website within these link
-A new element called "id" which allows for users to quickly access a section
-In css added the <li> element in the left-column to make it easier to read
-Also added text within each HTML, making the website more self explanitory 

This following week I plan on finishing up my project by adding the necessary information in each HTML.
